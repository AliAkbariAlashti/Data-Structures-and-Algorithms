# Josephus Problem Solver

This C++ program solves the Josephus problem, a famous theoretical problem in mathematics and computer science. The problem involves a group of people standing in a circle, and every k-th person is eliminated in a cyclic manner until only one person remains. The goal of the program is to determine the position of the last remaining person.

## Problem Statement

Given `n` people standing in a circle, every `k`-th person is eliminated in a cyclic manner until only one person remains. The task is to find the position of this last remaining person.

### Example:
For `n = 7` people and `k = 1` (eliminate every 1st person), the position of the last person remaining will be `7`.

## History and Background

The Josephus problem is named after Flavius Josephus, a Jewish historian who wrote about a particular event during the Jewish-Roman War around 67 CE. According to Josephus, a group of Jewish soldiers was trapped in a cave by Roman soldiers. Rather than surrendering, they chose to commit suicide by forming a circle, with every k-th person killing themselves until only one person remained. Josephus himself, allegedly, was in the group and managed to survive the ordeal.

He later wrote about the event, and the problem was named after him. It has since become a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, often used to demonstrate recursion, algorithm design, and circular data structures such as circular linked lists.

## Problem Solution

### How the Algorithm Works:

To solve the Josephus problem, the goal is to find the position of the last person remaining after repeatedly eliminating every k-th person from the group.

The algorithm can be approached both iteratively and recursively. In this program, we use an **iterative approach** to solve the problem. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **Initialization**:  
   We start by assuming that the position of the last remaining person in a circle of one person is `0` (since there's only one person, their position is `0` in 0-indexed notation).

2. **Iterative Calculation**:  
   As we increase the number of people in the circle from 2 up to `n`, we update the position of the last remaining person after every elimination. The formula used for this is:

   ```
   position = (position + k) % i
   ```

   Where:
   - `position` is the current position of the last remaining person for a circle of size `i-1`,
   - `k` is the step size (every k-th person is eliminated),
   - `i` is the current number of people in the circle.

   This formula calculates the new position of the last remaining person after the elimination process for each increase in the circle size.

3. **Final Result**:  
   Once all eliminations are done and the circle size has grown to `n`, the position will be the 0-indexed position of the last person remaining. Since the problem typically uses 1-indexing (where positions start from 1 instead of 0), we return the result adjusted by adding 1 to it.

### Formula Breakdown:

- For a circle of size 1, the last remaining person is obviously at position `0`.
- For a circle of size 2, the position is calculated as `(0 + k) % 2`.
- For a circle of size 3, the position is updated as `(previous_position + k) % 3`, and so on, until we calculate the position for a circle of size `n`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Let's consider `n = 7` people and `k = 3` (every 3rd person is eliminated). Here's how the algorithm works:

1. Start with a circle of 1 person. The position is `0` (because there's only one person).
2. For a circle of 2 people, the new position is calculated as `(0 + 3) % 2 = 1`.
3. For a circle of 3 people, the position becomes `(1 + 3) % 3 = 1`.
4. For a circle of 4 people, the position becomes `(1 + 3) % 4 = 0`.
5. For a circle of 5 people, the position becomes `(0 + 3) % 5 = 3`.
6. For a circle of 6 people, the position becomes `(3 + 3) % 6 = 0`.
7. For a circle of 7 people, the position becomes `(0 + 3) % 7 = 3`.

Thus, for `n = 7` and `k = 3`, the last person remaining is at position `4` in 1-indexed notation.

## Code Explanation:

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

// Function to calculate the position of the last remaining person in the Josephus problem
// n: number of people
// k: the step (interval) for elimination
int josephus(int n, int k) {
    int position = 0; // Initial position of the last remaining person (0-indexed)
    
    // Loop to calculate the position of the last remaining person based on the number of people
    for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
        position = (position + k) % i; // Update the position after each elimination
    }

    return position + 1; // Adjust to 1-indexed (since the problem usually uses 1-based indexing)
}

int main() {
    int n = 7;  // Number of people
    int k = 3;  // Step size for elimination

    cout << josephus(n, k) << endl; // Output the position of the last remaining person
}
```

### Key Points:
- **Iterative Solution**: The algorithm uses a loop to progressively calculate the position of the last remaining person.
- **0-Indexed to 1-Indexed Conversion**: The result is converted to 1-indexed before returning, as the Josephus problem is usually described using 1-based indexing.
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.

## Applications

The Josephus problem is often used to teach concepts like recursion, circular linked lists, and modular arithmetic. It also has real-world applications in problems where resources (such as people, tasks, or objects) are eliminated in a cycle, such as in resource scheduling and task management.
